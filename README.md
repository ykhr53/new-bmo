# Prerequisites

## GitHub personal access token

You need **repo** and **admin:repo_hook** permissions.

-   [Creating a personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token)

## Chatbot for Slack notification

We use Slack notification with [AWS Chatbot](https://aws.amazon.com/chatbot/) for monitoring Pipeline events.
You need to create a Chatbot slack client in advance to enable slack notification.

-   [Configure an AWS Chatbot client for a slack channel](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dtconsole/latest/userguide/notifications-chatbot.html#notifications-chatbot-configure-client)

## Secrets Manager

You need to store your App's slack token and user name in a Secrets Manager secret named 'SlackTokenForBMO'.

```
SLACK_TOKEN: <App's slack token> (something begins with xoxb- or xoxp-)
APP_UNAME: <App's user name> (something like U01234ABCDE)
GITHUB_TOKEN: <GitHub access token>
SLACK_WS_ID: <Slack WorkSpace ID for notification>
SLACK_CHANNEL_ID: <Slack Channel ID for notification>
```

## Deploy target region (Optional)

Please specify deploy target regions in `src/lib/configuration.ts`.
By default, BMO deploys a pipeline to Prod stage's region.

# How to develop

Each command was implemented as a module extends `Behavior` interface in `src/lambda/modules/behaviors/`.
`Behavior` has following items.

* `type`: unique key of the command
* `triggerPattern`: regex as triggers the command when it matches a message in slack
* `reaction`: function executed when the command triggered

You can create new commands by adding modules to `src/lambda/modules/behaviors/` and exporting them from `src/lambda/modules/behaviors/index.ts`.
